## Sistem kvaliteta / Quality Management System

The quality management system, applied to engineering practice and methods, as well as specialized engineers make Neopetrol competent for the implementation of very complex projects, with different contractual obligations.

Our projects are made and executed on time, within budget and with a constant focus on the needs of the client, supported by teamwork and constant improvement of the organization of work and business.

Re-certification by an independent certification body is performed every three years, and revision once a year.

**Quality Policy Statement**  
Neopetrol Inženjering doo has implemented a quality management system in accordance with the ISO 9001:2015 standard.  
Each individual project is led by a project manager (PM), who is a senior engineer with appropriate licenses and a list of references, as well as the necessary work experience. The project manager monitors the progress of the project, the coherence of different disciplines and the transfer of information between project teams.  
The Chief Engineer (LE) oversees the operation of the PM and ensures that all documentation produced is in accordance with applicable law and standards and is developed in accordance with the QMS.  
Each department has its own senior engineer who coordinates the design process in its department and/or discipline.  
Change management is always done through the project manager, who takes care of any change, registers when and why a certain change was made, who monitors its implementation, what is the deadline and who should verify it.  
The nomenclature of documents is subject to exact procedures. Each document has a unique document number, as well as its revision, either internal or external.  
After a specific document is created, checklists are used to correct errors. Each document is first checked by the author and then by a document control engineer (licensed engineer).  
Any document that is forwarded to an investor or public institution must be in accordance with applicable law, standards and prepared with good engineering practice.  
All documents are stored on a highly secured internal server with limited or no availability outside the company. Documents may leave the server only with a certified written request, approved by the project manager, or if the contract provides otherwise.  
Reporting is tailored to the needs of each individual client. There are defined forms for emails, notes, meeting minutes and other correspondence. Before the start of the project, together with the client, a project management protocol is created that defines the path of information, methods of data exchange, as well as all other procedures necessary for fast and quality work on the project.
